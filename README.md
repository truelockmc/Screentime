# 📊 Screentime

A lightweight, user-friendly application to monitor your PC usage on **Linux** and **Windows**. Track your screen time, and go touch Grass.

## What is Screentime?
Like the Name suggests it is a Screentime monitoring Tool, for Windows and Linux. It has useful Statistics, low resource Usage and no unneccessary Bloat. It doesnt have any branding, because i thought it would be better if it was just a simple 'default' Screentime App.
